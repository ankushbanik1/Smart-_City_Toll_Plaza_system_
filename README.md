# Smart-_City_Toll_Plaza_system_
 Abstract-  Now days there is a huge rush in the toll plazas in order to pay the toll tax. Therefore in order to reduce the traffic jam and to save time &amp; also to reduce the money loss. We have designed project for the automation in toll tax payment using cv. This concept explains the implantation of automation in toll plaza which is a step towards improving the monitoring of vehicles, travelling in predetermined routes. The aim of our project is to design a system which automatically identifies an approaching vehicles and record vehicles number and time. If the vehicle belongs to the authorized person, it automatically opens the toll gate and a predetermined amount is automatically deducted from its account. This translates reduced Traffic congestion at toll plazas and helps in lower fuel consumption. This is very important advantage of this system
